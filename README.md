Hello, little horse lovers! 🐴
Did you know that horses have their favorite foods, just like you do? Let’s learn about what horses love to munch on!
Grass 🌿
Horses love to eat grass! It's like their salad. They use their big, strong teeth to munch on it all day long when they are outside.
Hay 🌾
When horses can't eat grass, they eat hay. Hay is dried grass, and it's packed into big, fluffy bundles. It’s like a crunchy snack for them!
Grains 🌽
Horses sometimes get a special treat called grains. This can be oats, barley, or corn. It's like their breakfast cereal!
Fruits and Vegetables 🍏🥕
Horses enjoy yummy fruits and vegetables too! They love apples, carrots, and even bananas. But just like us, they should eat these in small amounts.
Water 💧
Horses need lots of water to stay healthy and happy. They drink water from big buckets or troughs. Imagine drinking a whole lot of water every day!
Fun Fact!
Sugar Cubes and Treats 🍬
As a special treat, horses sometimes get sugar cubes or special horse cookies. But just like candy for us, it’s only for special times!
Remember, horses need a balanced diet to stay strong and gallop around. So, next time you see a horse, you’ll know exactly what they like to eat!
