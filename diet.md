Hello, little horse lovers! 🐴 <br>
Did you know that horses have their favorite foods, just like you do? Let’s learn about what horses love to munch on! <br>

Grass 🌿 <br>
Horses love to eat grass! It's like their salad. They use their big, strong teeth to munch on it all day long when they are outside. <br>

Hay 🌾<br>
When horses can't eat grass, they eat hay. Hay is dried grass, and it's packed into big, fluffy bundles. It’s like a crunchy snack for them! <br>

Grains 🌽 <br> 
Horses sometimes get a special treat called grains. This can be oats, barley, or corn. It's like their breakfast cereal! <br>

Fruits and Vegetables 🍏🥕 <br>
Horses enjoy yummy fruits and vegetables too! They love apples, carrots, and even bananas. But just like us, they should eat these in small amounts. <br>

Water 💧 <br>
Horses need lots of water to stay healthy and happy. They drink water from big buckets or troughs. Imagine drinking a whole lot of water every day! <br>

Fun Fact! <br>
Sugar Cubes and Treats 🍬 <br>
As a special treat, horses sometimes get sugar cubes or special horse cookies. But just like candy for us, it’s only for special times! <br>
Remember, horses need a balanced diet to stay strong and gallop around. So, next time you see a horse, you’ll know exactly what they like to eat! <br>
